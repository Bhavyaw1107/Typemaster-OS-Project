Typing with punctuation helps improve accuracy, focus, and rhythm. It forces us to pay attention to every small detail — commas, periods, and quotation marks — which improves muscle memory and precision.

Many people underestimate the role of punctuation in writing. It doesn't just structure sentences; it shapes tone, timing, and emotion. Without punctuation, meaning becomes unclear or flat.

"Practice makes progress," is a phrase worth remembering. The goal is not to be perfect on day one, but to improve — step-by-step, word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence.

When typing, try not to rush. If you focus too hard on speed, accuracy tends to decrease. But if you focus on accuracy first, speed naturally improves over time. Ironically, slowing down makes you faster.
