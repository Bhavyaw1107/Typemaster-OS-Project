A paragraph is not just about how long it is. 
Many people think a paragraph must have a certain number of sentences, 
like four or five, or that it should take up half a page. 
But a paragraph is actually defined by how well the ideas inside it connect to each other. 
Even a single sentence can be a paragraph if it clearly expresses one main idea. 
What really matters is that all the sentences work together to support one central point. 
This main point guides the paragraph and keeps it focused. 
 and unity. A good paragraph feels complete, organized, 
 and meaningful, no matter how short or long it is.So instead of thinking about length, think about clarity
