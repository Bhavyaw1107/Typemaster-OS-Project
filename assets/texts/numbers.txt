in 2025 the world population crossed 8 point 1 billion with over 6 point 5 billion mobile users and 5 point 2 billion internet users every 24 hours nearly 500 million photos are uploaded 720 million messages are sent and more than 1 point 2 billion searches are made across various platforms every minute youtube records about 700 thousand hours of video views instagram handles more than 95 million posts and google processes nearly 100 thousand queries per second an average user scrolls around 300 meters per day through screens tapping their device almost 2600 times in 16 waking hours

a single human heart beats roughly 100 thousand times each day that is about 36 million times a year and over 2 point 8 billion beats in an average lifetime each beat pushes about 70 milliliters of blood through nearly 96 thousand kilometers of veins and arteries totaling more than 7500 liters daily the lungs process around 11000 liters of air every 24 hours and the brain consumes nearly 20 watts of energy per second equal to a dim light bulb during typing fingers move between 150 and 200 times per minute generating small bursts of speed that can exceed 20 kilometers of motion per week

in a normal workday lasting 8 hours the average person types nearly 40 thousand words which equals about 240 thousand characters across keyboards each keystroke takes about 150 milliseconds the total time spent pressing keys daily is roughly 1 hour and 40 minutes by the end of a month that becomes almost 50 hours of continuous key motion across 12 months the number grows beyond 600 hours in a lifetime of 40 working years it reaches more than 24000 hours or about 1000 full days spent typing in silence

computers have evolved at an exponential rate in 1948 the manchester baby had 32 words of memory in 1969 the apollo guidance computer ran at just 1 megahertz by 1985 processors reached 10 megahertz by 2000 they crossed 1000 megahertz or 1 gigahertz and by 2025 average smartphones operate above 3200 megahertz performing billions of operations per second the difference between 1 megahertz and 3200 megahertz is a factor of 3 point 2 million meaning modern devices are 3 million times faster while using less than one tenth the power consumption per instruction

in 1 minute the world sends 231 million emails 69 million instant messages and 16 million text messages over 3 point 8 million google searches are made 1 point 2 million facebook logins occur and 350 thousand tweets are posted tiktok users watch over 167 million videos and spotify streams 70 thousand songs in the same 60 seconds the data traffic in that single minute equals about 6 point 5 petabytes which is roughly 6 point 5 million gigabytes every hour the internet transfers close to 400 million gigabytes of data each year that becomes more than 3 point 5 zettabytes a scale beyond imagination

the human body contains about 37 trillion cells 86 billion neurons 206 bones and 600 muscles a strand of dna in one cell measures 2 meters if stretched out multiplied by 37 trillion cells it equals more than 74 trillion meters or roughly 74 billion kilometers that is enough to reach the sun about 490 times every breath pulls in 500 milliliters of air multiplied by 20 breaths per minute that equals 10 liters each minute 600 liters per hour and more than 14000 liters every day over a lifetime of 80 years a human breathes roughly 400 million liters of air these numbers show that every second every minute and every action is a quiet sum of infinite repetition
